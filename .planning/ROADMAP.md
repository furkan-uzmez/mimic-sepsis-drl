# Roadmap: MIMIC Sepsis Offline RL

## Overview

This roadmap turns the locked offline-RL design decisions from `implematation_plan_gpt.md`
and the research summary into a clinically grounded delivery path. The sequence follows
the real dependency chain of a retrospective sepsis benchmark: first freeze cohort and
time anchors, then lock leakage boundaries, then build the MDP contract, then train and
compare policies, and only then interpret them through OPE, safety diagnostics, and
reproducible reporting. The core training path must remain portable across Apple Silicon
`Metal/MPS` and NVIDIA `CUDA` laptops rather than becoming CUDA-only.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Cohort Definition** - Lock the eligible adult ICU Sepsis-3 study population.
- [x] **Phase 2: Onset Anchoring and Episode Grid** - Assign one usable onset time and deterministic 4-hour windows per episode.
- [x] **Phase 3: Split Manifests and Leakage Boundaries** - Freeze patient-level data partitions before any train-only fitting.
- [x] **Phase 4: State Representation Pipeline** - Build leakage-safe continuous state vectors from a documented feature contract.
- [x] **Phase 5: Treatment and Reward Encoding** - Convert therapies and outcomes into the fixed MDP action-reward contract.
- [x] **Phase 6: Transition Dataset and Baseline Benchmarks** - Export replay-ready transitions and simple comparison baselines.
- [x] **Phase 7: CQL Reference Training** - Train the first conservative offline RL policy on the finalized dataset.
- [x] **Phase 8: Comparative Offline RL Experiments** - Add BCQ/IQL runs and experiment artifacts on the same contract.
- [x] **Phase 9: Evaluation, Safety, and Reproducible Package** - Validate model claims with OPE, safety checks, ablations, and reproducible outputs.
- [x] **Phase 10: CQL Final Evaluation and Report** - Multi-seed CQL sweep plus IQL reporting extension with bootstrap CIs, support diagnostics, and project report figures.
